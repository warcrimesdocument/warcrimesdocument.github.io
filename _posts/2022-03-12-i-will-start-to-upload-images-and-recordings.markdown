I've been searching for ways to document my brain function because of all the more intense injuries they have been causing to my head 
lately. While I've been doing it they have been damaging my head even more strongly, causing frequent aches in my head, and at the time they are trying to distress me 
about the probable brain damage. 
They keep torturing me and impairing my brain every day. They are still frequently trying to cause emotional outbursts. 

I will try to document some of my brain functions by recording myself reading a passage of text I haven't read before and then try to write down the passage shortly afterwards. I will also start working on developing a simple multiplayer strategy game when I'm not studying or working. 
From today I will start uploading images and recordings containing evidence of what they are doing. I'm also going to start 
searching for and contact appropriate people who might be interested in this information.
