The damage they are causing to my head has been getting more serious. I have to find ways to measure 
functions of my brain to see if I can detect and document any permanent damage.
They keep torturing me and they're still causing extensive impairments of my brain every time I'm studying.

After I wrote the part of the suicide attempt down on this site they have started to damage my head in a different way where it feels like the oxygen to my head is greatly reduced.
