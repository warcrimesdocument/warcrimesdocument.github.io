Every day they are engaging in frequent desperate attempts to really anger me in order to provoke an emotional outburst and 
an upheaval in the way in which I'm handling the situation. They are trying to get me to impulsively contact the authorities and people close to me 
about the critical situation and the war crimes I'm being subjected to. 
They do diverse things to my body and my emotional state where they are trying to cause numerous stressful situations. While they are doing this they simultaneously
frequently insult me in different ways and cause strong and uncomfortable pains to my head. 

They are doing things to my body and are damaging me in different ways. They recently caused strong pains to the blood vessels on the side of my neck
while I was exerting my body.
